This is my first GitHub repositor.  A GitHun repository can ve compared to a folder. A repository has multiple files but it must have an index.html file. 

My defintion of it it something that you can store something in. Just like a building, GitHub is that building that contains all the apartments in it. Or like a jar than can contain each individual jelly beans in. 

ALL GitHub repositories MUST HAVE the .github.io extension
